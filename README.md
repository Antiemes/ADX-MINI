
## Summary

ADX-MINI, ADX-MI2 and ADX-MI3 (Arduino Digital Tranceivers)


## Description


The ADX-MINI is a simple digital HF tranceiver that uses a CD2003 receiver chip
and a Class-E QRP transmitter. It is meant to be used with the WSJT/X software
and a host computer (or phone or tablet).

The ADX-MI2 is an enhanced version of ADX-MINI that adds onboard USB soundcard capabilities. This simplifies the connections to the host computer. The ADX-MI2 and ADX-MINI are firmware compatible.

The ADX-MI3 replaces the UI pushbuttons and status LEDs with an OLED and additional CAT commands. Because of the UI and CAT changes, the ADX-MI3 is not firmware compatible with the ADX-MINI and ADX-MI2.
